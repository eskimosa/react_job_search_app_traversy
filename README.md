React Jobs Project (YouTube)
--

A Job Listing platform developed as part of a React.js course, demonstrating core React concepts like components, props, state management, and data fetching. The platform allows users to view job listings with detailed descriptions, and filter jobs by criteria such as location and type. To simulate a backend, the project integrates JSON-Server, providing a mock API for handling job data.
This project serves as a practical introduction to React's fundamentals while building a functional, interactive web application.
